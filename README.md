# Market Basket Analysis Project

This project applies Market Basket Analysis techniques to a dataset to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior, commonly used for recommendations and product association insights.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following main folders:

- **env**: The virtual environment containing all dependencies.
- **app**: Contains the main application code for market basket analysis.
- **project**: The core project files, including scripts for data processing, association rule mining, and visualization.

## Key Components

- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing steps for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
